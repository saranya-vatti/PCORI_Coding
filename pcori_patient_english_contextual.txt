none
depressing for me
more accurate location where i have pain in the pain assesment body image.

Well I feel like this program is a good program for people who are my condition because if anything to help the pain in to get you buy is a good thing otherwise that's about all I have to say about it Ida can't hurt anything to try to do this program you can only help so I would recommend it thus far.
i would rather talk to my nurse about my pain than to the computer because i m always in bed and do not use the computer and cant use the tablet even when  i am trained,its just hard to do in my situation.
I was very impressed with an ISO who was delivered this the laptop program to me the assessment program and I feel like something like this year in the future will be used by everyone so I'm very impressed even though I'm not familiar with it as I explained it to me in a clear and the defining the way so I'm very happy to give this a try and hope that I do it correctly and thank her very much for help and thank you very much for sending it with her.
it's okay
good assement, new things i learned about pain
the computer is very difficult for me to do because i dont work on tablet.unless my family is there to help.

i recomend that its a good program to have to patience with yourself and others
like the idea
none
should be a tool to aid in diagnosis, particully prior to office visit or if patient does not feel well enough to travel for an office visit.
soetimes it was hard to concentrate and answers some of the pain questions.
its a good way to share information that you may not be able to talk about to anoher person such as  nurse or doctor
Some technical issues to the programe.
Have patiants write down user & password on a piece of paper, so that they dont forget it.  Have auto correct for spelling.
the programe is good but a lot of times it freezes.
it was hard for me at times when i m in pain and could not finish.
very good
sometimes i forgetv to tell the doctor or nuse but with the computer they will know when i go there
it was a good way of reporting my pain at times.
well, in some ways it was annoying -
omputer stalled a lot  put next on same page   more written instructions
no
do more research about cancer
multiple languages offererd
its easier to talk to the person instead the computer.
none
none

The computer freezes alot and you just dontknow where to go next, i also think with older  adults the touch screen is really sensitive.
Well in my case my wife types it all in I just answer questions.  She also knows more about my medication and when to take it. I the patient do not have any knowledge on computers. She said it was ok
The scale of 0 to 10 could be better. 5 is nit a moderate number
it should be used prior to medical appointments and when pain orpain meds need changing
great i loved it
its a good thing for the  future folks.
larger print
completing the program each day was a total nuisance
It was difficult at times to use this computer.
i think the program is excellent

When using computer it becomes too confusing for me to use.
none
Used terms that are not clinical the people understand
make thecwords bigger
the program is hard because i dont work on computers and at times i m tired and sick.
the way the questions are asked could be mas claro
stronger battery and better connection shorten the amount of questions
very easy to use
this might be difficult for a hospice patient or someone in pain to assess daily.
i am not computer savy and may not feel comfortable using this kind of technonlogy to report my pain or discomfort
To futher study pain and treatment is good to know how patient feel to better pain control
no
more doctors should let there patients know about this program
longer to do the program would be a good idea. the reason is my pain pattern may change from week to week so may help if I  keep it more than a week.
I enjoyed this way
Make it easier to save data.
I really enjoyed the videos, everyone should have them.
it would be good to ask especific questions, and not just answer the same thing over and over
no
keep up the good work
i was please to participate and the RA was very helpful and pleasent.
its a good program to report the pain and its nature.
i see this is a good program for patients with pain to report their pain to their nurse or a doctor.
maybe add  a section for patient to log in a complete picture of meds and times taking them
This way of describing your pain makes you better understand your pain.
the program was able to let me report my pain.
all people can  use computers
daily frequencies of reporting daily data was a constant reminder of pain and i dont like to be reminded.
none.
it was great working with Anna and good program for hospice.
none
the only problem i had was i couldnt tell them how many pills
Great program and Very pleasant staff.
good way for people to reprt their pain.
i think that is a great program and it for everyone's good
Somevofvtge questions should be broken down into two or more questions as a single questions now
It is much easier to do to use this computer than it is to have to sit on the phone and wait for the doctor on nurse to call you back
Keep it going
none
none
veryhelpful when you are in painthand hard to put the data in.
none
I think that the nurses will get a better idea of what kind of pain in the end by reading my computer rather than listen to me
i liked that you were able to show pain in the front and the back, usually you just show the front// using the stylus is easier than usingbyour finger//
i think this works if you are not in pain and fill up to taking this. i don't think too many older seniors will want to do this study, especially if they don't work on computers.
enjoyedthis version of pain
I'm glad to see people digging into a way to make pain control better
