might have trouble to remember when
dr time is short computer has reminders to help eplain dr looks at me like what are you rying to say
;
;
;
;
tiring
as long as someone else is using the computer it's fine--I do not want to communicate to my doctor on a computer
gives me something to do instead of just talking to ohers drawing it takes your mind off it
this prefers to talk
easy but hard with pain
good program
cn talkor communicate with computer maybe he would respond
keep on doing it
i use a computrt but may be easier to talk about it
;
medicn in way
;
;
hard for someold folk
not all can use this
should be for those who want it, I like speaking for myself
I WOULD RATHER TALK TO A MACHINE IT DOESN'T GET UP AND WALK AWAY FROM YOU
words too small, forget to use it
a lot would no0t understand
all right for some not everyone
;
no, does not ask what type of pain you have focuses on level
just to use
ask me to tell you I know more than the coimputer
sometimes people in pain cannot talk and pressing a button to tell the dr in his office he would know the number of pain. If I press 8 for miss parker the dr would know the urgency. So I think computer is good for patients at bedside.
NEED ASSISTANCE
not sure if all could handle it
;
none, too uncomfortable
too tired
I think it is great
;
I like using computer AND telling doctor about my pain. I think having a computer is very helpful, I would like to report your pain as it happens on a daily basis. I would like someone to know it changes over 24 hours.
some are too old and sick
no, for me this worked out pretty well.
;
people need help
some folks need help dailoy
cannot type well, eliminate typing,
;
god to havein the home
none
have someone assist the patient always
It should be used on a regular basis. It is like a friend
;
make the computer more user freindly.
;
;
;
;
;
just because you are talking to the computer,does not meanthat you don't want to talk to people, you get lonely
;
Word could be slightly larger
Good idea
;
this is a great way to check on the scale of pain for both you and i
;
daily you keep for the nurse to review
;
;
it was easy to use.
;
;
;
IT WOULD BE BETTER IF USED DIRECTLY BY THE DOCTOR
IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ALL HOSPICE PATIENTS TO HELP WITH THEIR PAIN MANAGEMENT
;
;
;
;
larger print and stuff on a page would of made it easier
;
excessage verbage could be removed
This is very helpful, especially if no one is around at least you can report it here.
;
;
its actually pretty good and helpful right now but lay people will probably bbenefit more by using simpler terms
;
;
make it assessable to everybody
;
;
keep the good work up with the computer, you created a beautiful thing, thanks
;
too long
Unable to draw on the diagram with out more practice, shake to much and screen to sensitve so that drawing could not be completed without assistance
questions are too long, surveys are too long
;
;
;
;
;
mose training
;
;
;
;
;
;
some of the questions should be reworded to be more understable, ie question of "enjoyment"
;
;
It is difficult to answer some of the questions, because you don't know if your answer is right or wrong. Also the area of weakness is not well addressed.
;
When the program is finished we are given a personal computer to keep for the rest of our stay in Hospice.
;
;
;
;
;
;
;
who am I to say if people should have access to computer to report pain, I rather call my doctor to report my pain over the phone
;
The computer is okay, but I am not interested in using one. I prefer to talk with people.
;
;
;
;
;
;
;
;
It's very helpful to be able to express your feelings totally about your pain.
more words in some categories to describe things.
;
;
;
;
;
;
;
;
;
;
Working on the computer is a little hard on older people. It might be difficult for people who are not familiar with computers and using it depends on how sick you are.
;
;
;
;
I enjoyed using this computer.
I think the questions have been helpful.
;
;
;
;
;
it was easy and helpful
