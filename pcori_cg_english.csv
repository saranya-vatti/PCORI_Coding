Use Microsoft Surface tablets there a lot easier to use because it comes with a keyboard that lights up and the voice to text feat. should be explained,Positive,3
My first suggestion is to use a Microsoft Surface tablet because it has a stylus pen has a magnet has conveniently attached to the side of the computer my second suggestion is to automatically populate the medication as it would be impossible for a patient in pain to have to go through and enter the exact milligrams and the exact medication on a daily basis it would be a lot easier if the medication was already there and they could just change the dose or delete the medication if needed enter enter it every single day,Negative,1

Yes my comments about the pain assessment I think that it's a good program and I think that using the program at a given time of pain would help the patient be able to make comments and suggestions a lot faster than waiting to see the doctor or the nurse thank you,Neutral,2
I think that it's much quicker as far as communicating with the nurse or hospital. It saves time and perhaps has feedback for the patient; lessens waiting time.,Neutral,2

It is easy to use and think it can easily be used by even the less experienced user,Neutral,2
I think this would only be helpful if the patient has a caregiver that can help each day,Neutral,2
I believe this is a wonderful program for cancer research. plus it gives the patient something to do for a distraction; and lets them know some one cares about them enough to want to know how this disease makes them feel; or what there pain level is.,Positive,3
i thought this was a great program; and it is distracting to those who are home and cant get out. plus it lets the patients know there is a study out there; that will help better understand how patients feel.,Positive,3
new participant no comments at this time.,Neutral,2
to many pain descriptions can be confusing,Neutral,2
I feel that maybe the signal should be stronger so that the program can be assessed easily and that there is no long pause when answering or going to the next section or question.,Negative,1
Voice control would be really great just in case you're in too much pain to write. Also for the computer to talk back to you and understand you when you answer it verbally,Negative,1

I think as overwhelmingly as it seems in the begining trying to adjust tothis whole Holspice would be great because thiscould raise the pain management awareness,Negative,1
there some questions were confusing,Negative,1
I think this system is great  it give the paitent; and caregivers better communication skill. That we can then share with the nurse; and doctor.,Positive,3
Nothing at this time.,Neutral,2
This is a good program but I do think that the caregiver should be able to answer the same questions that the patient has. Example,Positive,3
my aunt doesn't always tell the truth about whats going on with her; and I know what she is going through. I would like to be able to put in what I see also.,Negative,1

wonderful program,Positive,3
this program is helpful,Neutral,2
My dad could not stay focused on the questions or answers. He would never have been able to answer the questions on his own. The questions were too long and the time it took to complete it everyday was cumbersome and not very realistic for a family in a hospice situation who are already over-taxed. I am accustomed to reading research instruments and I felt this one was very poorly designed.,Negative,1
no suggesion right now .,Neutral,2
its good program for patients to have,Positive,3
It was something very different. Its very good for to keep up with patients pain; especially those that's going through cancer. Some of them are in constant pain.,Neutral,2
