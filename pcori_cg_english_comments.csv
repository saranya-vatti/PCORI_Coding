Use Microsoft Surface tablets there a lot easier to use because it comes with a keyboard that lights up and the voice to text feat. should be explained,Positive,3
My first suggestion is to use a Microsoft Surface tablet because it has a stylus pen has a magnet has conveniently attached to the side of the computer my second suggestion is to automatically populate the medication as it would be impossible for a patient in pain to have to go through and enter the exact milligrams and the exact medication on a daily basis it would be a lot easier if the medication was already there and they could just change the dose or delete the medication if needed enter enter it every single day,Negative,1
it was just ok,Neutral,2
depends on how ill the patient is can be confusinf if patient does not have experience with tablets,Neutral,2
There should always be someone around to help out with the survey; especially the elderly.,Negative,1

THE SPEED OF THEANSWERS CHANGING COULD BE FASTER,Negative,1

Yes my comments about the pain assessment I think that it's a good program and I think that using the program at a given time of pain would help the patient be able to make comments and suggestions a lot faster than waiting to see the doctor or the nurse thank you,Neutral,2
I think that it's much quicker as far as communicating with the nurse or hospital. It saves time and perhaps has feedback for the patient; lessens waiting time.,Neutral,2
I personally feel that the system is helpful as well as clear and concise; therefore I wouldn't change anything,Negative,1
No it wasn't hard help was there when I needed it,Negative,1
It was alot of question and understanding things,Neutral,2

i think its a good system to use during hospice,Neutral,2
a sometimes or other button,Neutral,2

No comments at all; assessment was fine.,Negative,1
I believe anyone who can do this on this with the capability should do this. There should be a written; brail and audio version.,Neutral,2
no suggestions. it should be available to everyone,Negative,1
Love it wish we had this to do with all pain but anyone that is on this program,Neutral,2
I noticed that the screen is too sensitive for some patients. My husband'S hands are shaky.,Negative,1
like it very much,Neutral,2
This computer program helps patients understand their situation.it puts everybody at the same page the doctors and the nurses.,Negative,1
Continue using,Neutral,2
Computer freezes sometime,Neutral,2
this should be available to all who have the capacity and ability - the connection needs to be better - the scale could be more visual with happy faces and sad faces; something visual to keep people focused and add a little lightness to the activity -,Neutral,2
Make it more user friendly by non freezing screens,Neutral,2
i really thinkthat this is a great way to help patients,Very positive,4
I thought the computer was fun and pretty easy for me,Positive,3
It is easy to use and think it can easily be used by even the less experienced user,Neutral,2
I think this would only be helpful if the patient has a caregiver that can help each day,Neutral,2
better stylus,Neutral,2
I believe this is a wonderful program for cancer research. plus it gives the patient something to do for a distraction; and lets them know some one cares about them enough to want to know how this disease makes them feel; or what there pain level is.,Positive,3
i thought this was a great program; and it is distracting to those who are home and cant get out. plus it lets the patients know there is a study out there; that will help better understand how patients feel.,Positive,3
the questions were too long and redundant it should save tge information like medicines; pain spots; and words to pick,Negative,1
to many pain descriptions can be confusing,Neutral,2
I feel that maybe the signal should be stronger so that the program can be assessed easily and that there is no long pause when answering or going to the next section or question.,Negative,1
Voice control would be really great just in case you're in too much pain to write. Also for the computer to talk back to you and understand you when you answer it verbally,Negative,1
I think this is an important feature. All should be allowed.,Positive,3
very easy nothing to approve,Neutral,2
only complaint would be concerning the stylus,Neutral,2
the program is a goood to help the patients.,Neutral,2
I think as overwhelmingly as it seems in the begining trying to adjust tothis whole Holspice would be great because thiscould raise the pain management awareness,Negative,1
esta bien,Neutral,2
It is another stepin the right direction. Keep up the good work.,Positive,3
it is a good program;i am sure it help the patient to explain their feelings better.,Positive,3
I think this system is great it give the paitent; and caregivers better communication skill. That we can then share with the nurse; and doctor.,Positive,3
This is a good program but I do think that the caregiver should be able to answer the same questions that the patient has. Example; my aunt doesn't always tell the truth about whats going on with her; and I know what she is going through. I would like to be able to put in what I see also.,Positive,3
the computer gets stuck ;the stylus was problem and sometime with finger cant press the questions and it might not work.,Negative,1
Yes; if the peason has some computer knowledge.,Neutral,2
Make good use out of it0,Neutral,2

I had some trouble with making the right selection due to touch screen sensitivity.,Positive,3
Pain should be measured everyday to see if the patient has intensity pain or less pain. By measuring enables the nurse to acess the amount of pain the patient is experiencing.,Neutral,2
it helps the nurse see how much pain the patient has on daily basics,Positive,3
i think that this is great thing for patiences to have this program,Positive,3
its gud they can learn about pain control,Neutral,2
The program froze a couple of times and I was unable to complete the assessment. It also would not be log in on Wednesday or Thursday.,Negative,1
i would prefer this program,Neutral,2
its goodprogram and i think it should be available to all people in hospice.,Negative,1
i think its very good; because sometime the patient is more comfy with their caregiver,Positive,3
wonderful program,Positive,3
this program is helpful,Neutral,2
My dad could not stay focused on the questions or answers. He would never have been able to answer the questions on his own. The questions were too long and the time it took to complete it everyday was cumbersome and not very realistic for a family in a hospice situation who are already over-taxed. I am accustomed to reading research instruments and I felt this one was very poorly designed.,Negative,1
larger print,Neutral,2
i prefer human communication,Neutral,2
You don't necessarily need to use the screen or take the time to use a screen to express what you're thinking so probably I don't need the computer,Negative,1
its good program for patients to have,Positive,3
It was something very different. Its very good for to keep up with patients pain; especially those that's going through cancer. Some of them are in constant pain.,Neutral,2

i think there should be emotional and stress questions,Neutral,2
this should be made more public,Neutral,2
give un complicated methods for usage; and timetables for doses,Negative,1
stylus and it is kind of very sensitive screen.,Positive,3

Make is easier to save data.,Neutral,2
i think its a great tool for the other people for the study,Positive,3
